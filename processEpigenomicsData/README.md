## Process Epigenomics Data 

DRAGON connects the sequence of the chromtin to its structure to predict chromatin folding starting from epigenomics data. The genome-wide histone modification and CTCF binding profiles availabe on [`ENCODE`](https://www.encodeproject.org), however, needs to be preprocessed into formats recognized by DRAGON. In particular, different histone modifications must be combined together to define chromatin states, and the oreitnation of each CTCF binding site needs to be identified. Check out the README in each folder for more details on data processing.
