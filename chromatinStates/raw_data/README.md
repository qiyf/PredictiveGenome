# chromatin states defined by ChromHMM

Please be aware to compile the ChromHMM from the following link before using:  
[http://compbio.mit.edu/ChromHMM/](http://compbio.mit.edu/ChromHMM/)

Chromatin states are defined based the epigenetic information of the following 6 cell types:
>GM12878  
>H1hesc  
>Helas3  
>Hepg2  
>Huvec  
>K562  

with download links of the 12 files for histone marks of each cell type be indicated in the ExtendDataSheet.
Scripts from src are used to calculate the chromatin states.
 
If new cell type(s) are added, please be aware of corresponding the new chromatin states with the present-defined ones.
