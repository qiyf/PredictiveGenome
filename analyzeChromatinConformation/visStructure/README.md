## Visualize the 3D structure

### Generate VMD script

To visualize the structure colored by chromatin states, VMD scripts for individual chromosome can be generated by using the code [`VMDmain.py`](./VMDmain.py) that is provided. [What are the outputs from this script?]

Usage:
```
python VMDmain.py [-C Celltype] [-c chromosome_id_array]
```
The manual would be available by executing:  
```
python VMDmain.py -h
```

### Visualize 3D structure with VMD

After generating the VMD scripts and in order to visualize the structure, open the VMD software (available at [http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/](http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/)) and click under `Extension/TK Console` option, go to the folder: [`./VMDScript/`](./VMDScript/), find the VMD script for the corresponding chromosome and load it in the VMD console. E.g., for Gm12878, chromosome 1, execute the following command in the VMD console:
```
play VMDColor_Gm12878_chr1.vmd
```
where a chromosome structure colored by chromatin states should be appearing in the display window. Then go to the path where the simulated .dcd file (trajectory) is located. E.g., for Gm12878, chromosome 1, 1st parallel running, it should be located in the [folder](../../runMolecularDynamics/run_folder/Gm12878/chr1/run00/), and execute the following command in the VMD console:
```
animate read dcd DUMP_FILE.dcd 
```
where the trajectory would be loaded and appearing in the display window.
